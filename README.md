# ArduinoLeonardo-PotentiometerSteering
A DIY steering wheel controller with potentiometer connected to Arduino Leonardo or other ATmega32u4 based device.
This is just a personal project but hopefully can serve as a further example/reference to add potentiometer functionality for others in their projects.
Also, this project was tested for Windows, not sure about MacOS or Linux.

## Instructions
Upload the sketch into your Arduino Leonardo (or other ATmega32u4 based devices).
Wire Potentiometer to Arduino's A0
